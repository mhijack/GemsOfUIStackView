# GemsOfUIStackView
Tutorial project is used to show some UIStackView tips

I created this sample project to demonstrate the tips I'm telling on my medium article.

You have to change initial view controller from **Main.storyboard** to see different tips. Forgive me for being lazy, I used the same view controller since the code part was easy ðŸ˜„
